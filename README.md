## 🎯 Why HelloAGENTS?

**The Problem:** AI agents are powerful but unpredictable—they produce inconsistent outputs, can't adapt to different task complexities, lack systematic requirement validation, and make decisions without transparency.

**The Solution:** HelloAGENTS introduces an **AI Programming Modular Skill System** with intelligent complexity routing, semantic intent analysis, structured requirement scoring, and human-centric interaction patterns that automatically adapt to your task needs.

| Challenge | Without HelloAGENTS | With HelloAGENTS |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------|
| **One-size-fits-all workflow** | Same heavy process for every change | Smart router picks 1 of 4 workflows via semantic + intent analysis |
| **Vague requirements accepted** | Agent guesses and fails | 10-point scoring system with targeted follow-up questions |
| **Black-box decision making** | No insight into why agent chose an approach | On-demand internal thinking with explicit uncertainty handling |
| **No state awareness** | Loses context between interactions | G12 state variables track packages, modes, and context |
| **Inconsistent outputs** | Random formatting and structure | G6 unified output format with mandatory validation |
| **Platform incompatibility** | Unix commands fail on Windows | Cross-platform rules with PowerShell syntax validation |
| **Unsafe operations** | Accidental production deployments | EHRB detection with automatic workflow escalation |

### 💡 Best For
- ✅ **Teams** needing intelligent workflow selection based on task complexity
- ✅ **Projects** requiring systematic requirement validation before coding
- ✅ **Developers** who want transparency in AI decision-making processes
- ✅ **Cross-platform projects** (Windows PowerShell + macOS + Linux)
- ✅ **Regulated industries** requiring full traceability and audit trails

### ⚠️ Not For
- ❌ One-off scripts without quality requirements
- ❌ Projects where "just make it work" is acceptable
- ❌ Environments without file system access

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- CLI environment with file system access (Codex CLI, Claude Code, or custom AI client)

### Installation

**Step 1: Copy the ruleset to your directory**

Choose your platform and language version:

- **For Codex CLI**: Copy folder to `~/.codex/`
  - Chinese: `Codex/Skills/CN` → `~/.codex/`
  - English: `Codex/Skills/EN` → `~/.codex/`

- **For Claude Code**: Copy folder to `~/.claude/`
  - Chinese: `Claude/Skills/CN` → `~/.claude/`
  - English: `Claude/Skills/EN` → `~/.claude/`

**Step 2: Configure language**

Edit the AGENTS.md header:

```yaml
# In AGENTS.md G1 section:
OUTPUT_LANGUAGE: English  # or "Simplified Chinese"
```

**Step 3: Verify installation**

Restart your terminal and ask:
```
"Show me the skills reference table"
```

**Expected:** Agent lists 5 skills (analyze, design, develop, kb, templates)

### First Use Example

```bash
# 1. Simple fix → Routes to Quick Fix (semantic: modification + micro scope)
"Fix the typo in src/utils/helper.ts line 42: 'respose' should be 'response'"

# 2. Medium task → Routes to Light Iteration (semantic: modification + small scope)
"Add error handling to login, signup, and password reset functions"

# 3. Complex task → Routes to Full R&D with requirement scoring
"Add user authentication with OAuth2"
# Agent will score requirements and may ask follow-up questions

# 4. Full authorization mode → Continuous execution
~auto "Refactor the database layer to use repositories"
```

**Expected Output (Quick Fix):**

```
✅【HelloAGENTS】- Quick Fix Mode Complete

- ✅ Change: Fixed typo 'respose' → 'response'
- 📁 Affected file: src/utils/helper.ts
- 📚 Knowledge Base: Updated module documentation

────
📁 Changes:
  - src/utils/helper.ts
  - helloagents/wiki/modules/utils.md

🔄 Next Step: Please verify the fix
```

**Expected Output (Requirement Scoring Follow-up):**

```
❓【HelloAGENTS】- Requirements Analysis

Current requirement completeness score: 5/10, unable to determine optimization goals and expected outcomes.

### Requirements Analysis Deep Dive

**The 10-Point Scoring System:**

<table>
<tr><th>Dimension</th><th>Points</th><th>What It Measures</th><th>Low Score Triggers</th></tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Goal Clarity</strong></td>
<td>0-3</td>
<td>Is the task objective clear and specific?</td>
<td>"Optimize code", "Make it better"</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Expected Results</strong></td>
<td>0-3</td>
<td>Are success criteria and deliverables defined?</td>
<td>No mention of expected behavior</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Scope Boundaries</strong></td>
<td>0-2</td>
<td>Is the task scope clearly bounded?</td>
<td>Open-ended requests</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Constraints</strong></td>
<td>0-2</td>
<td>Are time, performance, business limits stated?</td>
<td>No constraints mentioned</td>
</tr>

</table>

**On-Demand Internal Thinking:**

```
<thinking>
1. Analyze each scoring dimension:
   - Goal Clarity (0-3): User wants "optimization" but doesn't specify what → 1 point
   - Expected Results (0-3): No success criteria mentioned → 1 point
   - Scope Boundaries (0-2): "the code" is too vague → 0 points
   - Constraints (0-2): No constraints → 0 points
2. Evidence: User said "optimize the code" without specifics
3. Missing info: Which module? What problem? What metrics?
4. Total: 2/10 points
5. Decision: Must ask follow-up questions
</thinking>
```

**Targeted Follow-up Questions:**

The system asks only what it doesn't know:
- ✅ "Which module needs optimization?" (user hasn't specified)
- ✅ "What specific problem are you facing?" (not mentioned)
- ❌ ~~"What framework are you using?"~~ (already known from codebase)
- ❌ ~~"What's the project structure?"~~ (already scanned)

  - Read: By Develop step 1 in Full Auth mode
  - Clear: After read or process terminated

CURRENT_PACKAGE: Currently executing solution package path
  - Set: When Develop determines which package to execute
  - Use: Excluded from legacy plan scan
  - Clear: After migration to history/

MODE_FULL_AUTH: Full authorization command active state
MODE_PLANNING: Planning command active state
MODE_EXECUTION: Execution command active state
  - Track: Active special command state
  - Control: Silent execution behavior
  - Clear: When command completes or user cancels
```

### GPT/SKILLS Compliant Rule Structure

HelloAGENTS follows official guidelines for AI agent ruleset design:

```yaml
Rule Structure Pattern:
  - Global rules (G1-G12): Universal constraints and principles
  - Modular skills: Lazy-loaded detailed procedures
  - XML-like tags: <uncertainty_principles>, <routing_rules>
  - CRITICAL markers: ⚠️ for mandatory enforcement
  - Hierarchical organization: Phase → Step → Action

Output Format Compliance:
  - Template method pattern: Consistent structure across all outputs
  - Status symbols: ✅❓⚠️🚫❌💡 with defined meanings
  - Validation checklist: Self-check before output
  - Language rules: G1 OUTPUT_LANGUAGE enforcement
```

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: How does semantic analysis differ from keyword matching?</strong></summary>

**A:** Semantic analysis understands meaning, not just words:

| Input | Keyword Matching | Semantic Analysis |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| "Make login faster" | Might miss "faster" = performance | Understands: optimization request for login module |
| "Fix the thing that broke" | Can't determine what "thing" is | Asks targeted follow-up about specific error |
| "Add OAuth like we discussed" | Doesn't know context | Checks conversation history for OAuth details |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: Why is requirement scoring important?</strong></summary>

**A:** Without scoring, agents often:
- Start coding with incomplete understanding
- Produce solutions that miss the actual need
- Require multiple rounds of correction

With the 10-point system:
- Clear threshold (≥7) before proceeding
- Targeted questions fill specific gaps
- Higher first-attempt success rate
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: What happens when the agent is uncertain?</strong></summary>

**A:** G3 Uncertainty Principles require:
1. **Explicit disclosure**: "⚠️ Uncertainty Factor: [description]"
2. **List assumptions**: What the decision is based on
3. **Conservative choice**: Safer/more complete path
4. **Alternatives**: 2-3 options if reasonable

Example:
```
⚠️ Uncertainty Factor: Scope at Quick Fix vs Light Iteration boundary
- Assumption: Implementation may touch more files
- Decision: Using Light Iteration (safer choice)
- Alternative: If confirmed ≤2 files, can switch to Quick Fix
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: How does state management prevent context loss?</strong></summary>

**A:** G12 state variables maintain:
- **CREATED_PACKAGE**: Links Design output to Develop input
- **CURRENT_PACKAGE**: Tracks what's being executed
- **MODE_***: Remembers active command context

This ensures:
- Develop executes the right plan (not an old one)
- Legacy scan excludes current work
- Commands can be cancelled cleanly
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: What makes HelloAGENTS "human-centric"?</strong></summary>

**A:** Several design choices:
- **Transparent decisions**: G3 explains why, not just what
- **Targeted questions**: Doesn't ask what it already knows
- **Unified format**: Predictable, consistent outputs
- **Phase confirmations**: User can review before proceeding
- **Safe defaults**: Conservative routing, EHRB detection
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: Is this compliant with GPT/SKILLS official guidelines?</strong></summary>

**A:** Yes, HelloAGENTS follows official patterns:
- **Modular architecture**: Skills loaded on-demand
- **XML-like tags**: For structured rule sections
- **CRITICAL markers**: Clear mandatory vs. optional rules
- **Template method**: Consistent output structure
- **State management**: Explicit variable tracking
</details>

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Routing Issues

**Problem:** Agent routes to wrong workflow

**Cause:** Ambiguous scope or missing context

**Solution:**
```bash
# ❌ Vague (uncertain scope)
"Add error handling"

# ✅ Specific (clear scope)
"Add try-catch error handling to login.ts and signup.ts (2 files, ~20 lines each)"
```

---

**Problem:** Requirement score always <7, constant follow-ups

**Cause:** Request lacks required dimensions

**Solution:**
```bash
# ❌ Missing dimensions (scores ~2-3/10)
"Optimize the code"

# ✅ All dimensions covered (scores 8-9/10)
"Optimize the ProductList component (src/components/ProductList.tsx)
 to reduce re-renders. Currently renders 50+ times per page load.
 Target: <10 renders. Must maintain existing filter functionality."
```

---

### State Issues

**Problem:** Wrong solution package executed

**Cause:** State variables not properly set/cleared

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check current state by asking:
"What is the current CREATED_PACKAGE and CURRENT_PACKAGE?"

# If stuck, reset by:
"Cancel current operation and start fresh"
```
